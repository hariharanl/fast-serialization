/**
 * applicable to classes. Defines for equal instances of this class only one copy must be transmitted.
 * hashCode() and equal() must be implemented correctly to make this work. If FST detects equal instances of
 * the annotaded class, only one serialized copy will be transmitted. When deserializing, the equal reference will
 * contain an exact copy of the first occurence of an equals instance in the object graph.
 *
 * Example: java.awt.Rectangle consists of 4 int's. If your object graph contains exact identical instances of a rectangle,
 * only one copy will be transmitted. This can reduce the size of Object Graphs significantly, but creates some additional
 * CPU costs when serializing. Only use if you actually write equal Objects.
 *
 * To enable this for system-classes, register this at the FSTConfiguration Object.
