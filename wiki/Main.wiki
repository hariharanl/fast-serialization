=FST - Fast Serialization Thingy=

Reimplements Java Serialization with focus on speed and size. It fully supports JDK-serialization specialities such as write/read Obejct, readreplace, runvalidation() etc. to allow drop-in replacement. Other features:

  * serialization can be optimized using annotations
  * custom serializers
  * conditional decoding (conditionally skip decoding parts of a stream)


The main target are high-speed grids/remoting architectures.
Supports java 1.7+
